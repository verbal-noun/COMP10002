Hello, what are you
 doing?
 
 Haha, I'm writing 
comp10002 programming assignment.
 Its REALLY 
fun, because we are doing
 text processing.
 

What 
means is that whatever I write
 in
 this input 
is going to get reformatted and presented 
 
as the text output of the program (written to 
but can easily be captured into a file using ">" 
a shell operator), 
 regardless of how
 
 it 
in the input,
 with embedded formatting commands 
the layout.
 

Cool, isn't it!
 

Now, here is some 
text with some other commands in it:
 
new line 

new line two; and
 
new line three.
 

And a new 
as well, taa-dahhh!
 262
And now the width has been shrunk down to thirty,
 whereas previously
 it was at the initial default value
 (see the handout for details).
 Changing either the left margin or the width
 always starts a new paragraph.
 That means you need to 
a bit careful, because...
 512

...if both margins get changed at the same time with consecutive
 commands, we don't want two blank inter-paragraph lines introduced,
 we just want one.
 (Note also that if you do want to have a line or paragraph that
 starts with a ".", you need to remember to put an extra space
 in front of it
 so that the "." does not get interpreted as a command.)
 



And note also that consecutive ".p" commands only cause a
 single paragraph break to be generated.
 


And the same with multiple 
commands in a row, they shouldn't add
 additional lines. And also, be sure that, for example,
 .p combinations *not* in column one don't get accidentally processed
 as commands!
 

Finally, you need to correctly handle extended strings like URLs
 such as
 http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/ammoffat/teaching/10002/ass1/
 (which is 62 characters) that are
 longer than the current width supposedly allows...
