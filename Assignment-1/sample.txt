Hello, what are you
      doing?

Haha, I'm writing my comp10002 programming assignment.
Its REALLY REALLY fun, because we are doing
			text processing.

What that means is that whatever I write
in
this input file is going to get reformatted and presented 
neatly                 as the text output of the program (written to stdout, but can easily be captured into a file using ">" as a shell operator), 
regardless		of how

it appears in the input,
with embedded formatting commands controlling the layout.

.b

.b
new line two; and
.b
new line three.

.w 30
